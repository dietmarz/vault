= AWS advantages

== Saved Costs
* Data Center Building, Security
* SW Licensing, Maintenance Contracts
* Hardware, Power, Internet, Cooling
* Staff: wages, design, operations etc.

== What is Cloud Computing
* Selfe Service
* On-Demand, always there
* Rapid elasticity
* Pay what you use

== Cloud Types
=== Private Cloud
* Everything selfservice: VM (or Container), Hypervisor, Hardware
* My Data stay in house!

=== IaaS Infrastructure as a Service
* Only VM, managed up to the OS
* Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
* Azure Virtual Machines
* Goolge Compute Engine

=== PaaS Platform as a Service
* Only your WAR and data files, managed up to the code
* AWS Elastic Beanstalk
* Azure WebApps
* Google: Compute App Engine

=== SaaS Software as a Service
* Nothing to manage, just consume the service
* Google Apps, Salesforce.com, Zoom...

== Cloud types
* (Public) Cloud: AWS, Azure, GCP
* Private Cloud (on-premise) managed in your own data center
* Hybrid Cloud: Mixture of both

== Pricing fundamentals Charge for:
* Compute: CPU RAM duration
* Storage: Quantity of data
* Outbound Data Transfer

== Global Infrastructure
* 25 Regions around the world
* Each Region has at least 2 Availability Zone
* An Availability Zone has one more more Data Centers
* An availability Zone is physically separate and isolated from each other
* Local Zones extend regions closer to the end-users, eg: CDN
* Regions are redundant connected

== 18 Public and private Services
* VPC = Virtual Private Cloud

== 19 The 6 Advantages!
* Only Operative Costs
** Pay as you go
** Tax-deductible in same year
* Aggregated Usage across thousands of customers
* Stop guessing capacity
* Increase speed agility
* Stop money for data centers, invest it to your business
* Go global in minutes

== IAM (Identity & Access Management) Web Service
* Delete root access keys
* Create individual users with MFA
* Use roles are used for delegating permissions for services
* Use manged policies for groups instead of own
* Authentication and Authorisation
* Users have no permissions by default
* Users are organized in Groups with policies

== ECS (Elastic Container Service)
* ECR = Elastic Container Registry = Image Registry

=== ECS Cluster
* ECS Cluster runs over several Availability Zones
* The Cluster contains Tasks (= running Container)
* The Task has a Task-Definition

=== ECS Service
* Runs in a Cluster
* Maintain desired count of Tasks

=== ECS Container Instance
* HW to run Tasks
* One per Availibility Zone

== ECS "EC2" vs "Fargate" Type
* Fargate (~= serverless)
* Provision by EC2 instances vs. Automatically by resources
* You manage EC2 instances vs. Automatically
* Charged per EC2 instance vs. Running Task
* EFS, EBS integration vs. No integration
* You handle cluster optimization vs. Fargate handle that for you
* Granular control over infrastructure vs. Limited control

== S3 = Simple Storage Service
* Object based storage system
* Object = Key + Value
