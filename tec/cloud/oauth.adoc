== Analogie
* Oauth Server = Hotel Reception
* Access Token = Keycard
* Google-Account = Identity Card

* Oauth issues access tokens to apps
* OpenID issues ID tokens to apps, and adds e.g. profile infos

* OpenID Identifying user, Authentication, user picture,...
* Oauth Accessing APIs, Authorization, no infos to the app about the user!

* 2.5 Spec language:
  ** User (uses device)        -> Resource Owner
  ** Device (runs Application) -> User Agent
  ** Application (calls API)   -> Oauth Client
  ** API (calls Oauth Server)  -> Resource Server
  ** Oauth Server              -> Authorization Server

* 2.6 Two types of clients
  ** Confidential Clients -> contains    Credentials, eg JWT
  ** Public Clients       -> contains NO Credentials
