== Basics
* Queue: Only one Consumer per Message!
* Topic: Every consumer gets the Message

* 3 Component types
  ** Producer (Sender = Endpoint)
  ** Consumer (Receiver = Endpoint)
  ** Pipe (called channel)

* Talks with Messages / Events to each other
* Producer Pipe Consumer are stackable
* Message = Header + Properties + Payload

== Types of Message Endpoints
* *Adapter*
  ** Connects channel to external system
  ** Are inbound (= into the channel) or outbound (= out of the channel)
  ** Symbol spitzes Viereck mit 2 parallele lineien
  ** Ready to use adapters for: Stream, File, JMS, JDBC, FTP, RSS, Mail, Mongo, UDP, Twitter...

* *Filter*
  ** Selection via Header or Payload
  ** Ready to use for: Expression Filter, Xpath Filter, XML Validation Filter
  ** CustomFilter implements MessageSelector interface
* Transformer
  ** eg xml to json, java-objects,

* *Router*
  ** Take from inbound to outbound channel
  ** `Content Router` examine the incoming message
  ** `Recipient list` routers deliver to all recipient channels

* *Enricher*
  ** is variant of transformer
  ** symbol is Square arrow Bigger-Square
* Service activator
  ** Calls a Service an optionally returns the response to the outbound channel
  ** ServiceBean does not need to implement an interface, it is registered within SI
  ** ServiceBean Method argument could be Message or AnyType means the Type of Payload or no Argument, just for Event triggering

* *Gateway*
  ** Serves as a facade to a SI system, it hides any SI msg API from your application
  ** eg: interface defining methods with `@Gateway(requestChannel="targetChannel"")`
  ** Symbol Arrow to outbound square

== Message Channels (=Pipe)
Two generated types of channels

* Pollable Channel
  ** Used as buffer
  ** Point to point, not for multiple User, who did pull?...
  ** Often used for Documents

* Subscribable Channel
  ** Multiple subscribers are informed each subscriber
  ** Not buffering its messages
